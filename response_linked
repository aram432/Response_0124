The first three chapters of "Linked" was very intriguing. Since I have not yet given serious thoughts on the concept 
of "network" - many of ideas were not only enlightening but also made me question, "why have I not thought about this before?"
I really liked the idea that networks emerge and evolve, but operates under its fundamental properties, as Euler claimed about brideges
in Konisberg. While networks might arise spontaneously, its behavior could be closely modeled and at most fundamental, it could be 
rigorously proved in mathematical terms. 

Without close analysis, no one would have expected that it just requires "one node" to form a society; even more, as long as everyone has
this one-node connection, there is a threshold at which a giant cluster emerges. Moreover, I really liked the idea of"injecting randomness" 
in analysis of networks, but still finding organizing principle behind it - that if there is no consistent fundamental properties, it is
not a network.

Network in real world could be more complicated than ideas in mathematics. Milgram's "Six degree of Separation," or Web's 19 degree would 
both be quite an simplication of real model (or if it can really be constructed); still, they suggest a concise and strikng picture of
entire network. Such small number of related notes seems to be general characteristic of networks. Logarithmic term of the formula easily 
shinks the huge network to create a "small world." While the number suggests some powerful ideas about how the web works, I would better 
understand it if I could look at the simplified formula, or the actual map that represents the study.
